# monty-hall-problem

montyhallproblemgame.py is the monty hall problem in a python console. I plan on making a gui for the game and then the next project would be to making some sort of version that runs through the program x number of times and uses [excel?] to quickly do a statistical analysis to prove the concetrated probablity of the monty hall problem.

Now onto the GUI...
